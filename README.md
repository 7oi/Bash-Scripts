Bash-Scripts
============

An assortment of my own bash scripts

NOTE:
_first-setup.sh_ is my script to run upon the first setup of my own computer. Most of my custom casks in it rely on files on a hard drive I have connected, so don't try to run it unless you're me (or just disable the custom_apps installation part).
